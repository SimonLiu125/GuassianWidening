# GuassianWidening

This Octave/Matlab code will take predicted "Dirac delta" type spectrum data and add Gaussian broadening. It is possible to change the spectrum range, finess, and line width.

The input file should be .txt, with comma as delimiter. The first column shall be peaks' x positions, and the second column shall be the line intensities.
